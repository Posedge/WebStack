## Chrome Extension

This chrome extension adds a stack for your tabs in chrome, allowing a workflow where you can "put stuff aside" while looking up something else, and then come back to it.

As of now, you can only install this for chrome locally. To do that, download and place jquery 2.1.3 (http://jquery.com/download/) in the WebStack folder, enable developer mode at the chrome extensions page, select "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the WebStack folder.
