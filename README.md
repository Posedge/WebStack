## Chrome Extension

This chrome extension adds a stack for your tabs in chrome, allowing a workflow where you can "put stuff aside" while looking up something else, and then come back to it.

### Installation

As of now, you can only install this for chrome locally. To do that, download and place jquery 2.1.3 (http://jquery.com/download/) in the WebStack folder, enable developer mode at the chrome extensions page, select "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the WebStack folder.

### TODO list

- [x] Ignore empty tabs
- [ ] Fix favicon when pushed before the site has loaded
- [ ] Allow deleting/opening tabs
- [ ] Allow reordering of Tabs
- [ ] Add Badge displaying number of items
- [ ] Save and restore the browsing history with the tab
- [ ] Add proper icon(s) and stylesheets
- [ ] Make this more accessible to the average user (rename "push" and "pop" and rewrite the description)
