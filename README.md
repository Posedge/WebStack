## Chrome Extension

This chrome extension adds a stack for your tabs in chrome, allowing a workflow where you can "put stuff aside" while looking up something else, and then come back to it.

### Installation

As of now, you can only install this for chrome locally. To do that, enable developer mode at the chrome extensions page, select "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the WebStack folder.

### TODO list

- [x] Ignore empty tabs
